This application should accept a command line argument using `process.argv`. The command line argument should be a search term and your application should make an API request to the [dad joke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) to search for a joke based on the search term. If it finds jokes matching the term, it should output a random joke, and should also save the joke to a file called `jokes.txt`. If it doesn't find a joke, it should log a message to the console telling the user that no jokes were found for that search term.
